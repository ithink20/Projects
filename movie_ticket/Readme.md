# Online Movie Ticket Booking System

#### Project Overview
Movie Booking System is a PHP/MySQL based seat and ticket reservation system allowing bookings in a few easy steps. 
Online users can browse through movies and select their choice of theatre for the preferred timing shows.
The customers will have the liberty to select different types and positions of seats as per the availability. 
Admin can add/update movies show timings and add new theatres to the database.

#### Project Scope
This cinema ticket booking system can be deployed on any website offering tickets for movies, theater, and other scheduled performances. 
Our movie ticket booking system is the perfect addition to all cinema, theater, and other events-related websites which call for a modern online reservation. 
Rush hours, long and hectic rows in front of cinema halls were the scenario of past as online movie tickets booking is the choice of
people these days, which has got its benefits in the so-called fast life people live in.
Few of the assured advantages of the project are :
* Assured time saving, as the lines on theatre ticket counters, lead to stress and wastage of oneâ€™s valuable time.
* Guaranteed availability of seats as the online portals provide the minute to minute booking status and seats available.
* Movie show-timings can be selected as per our requirements and at whatever time they want.
* If wanted people can cancel the cinema ticket booking easily if at any unwanted circumstances occur.
